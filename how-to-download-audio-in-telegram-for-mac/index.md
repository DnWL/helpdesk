# How to download some audio files in Telegram for Mac

Some audio files in Telegram for Mac are displayed with a note icon (or rarely with the release cover image). Such files are just playing and never appear in Downloads folder.

There is a way to download such.

First, let it start playing:

After that right click on the icon will open context menu with "Save as..." option:

Alternatively you can use [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/) app that has dedicated download icon for audio files.
