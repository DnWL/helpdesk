## Download accounting

To be able to download – be sure you also shared something anybody could appreciate with a download.

**1 download** of your file gives you **1 chatle**.  
**1 download** by you today takes **0.93 chatles**.

Your current balance is available in the *Stats* section of [@romnml_bot](https://t.me/romnml_bot) or in [roboard](https://romnml.rv7.ru).

In order to keep community members active, it is necessary to maintain a good balance of chatles. Members having less than **10 chatles** within **30 days** are being excluded.

## General rules

**Please, think twice (or more) before uploading anything. Do not upload just anything random. People who're uploading weird stuff (badly tagged files, bad transcodes, not relevant to rominimal) might be banned forever. We all love music here and treating it with respect.**

When one's uploaded music that is irrelevant to Romanian wave of minimal, a transcode, track from DJ mix or DJ mix itself, they might be fined. If you spotted that you accedentially uploaded one of the listed and labeled it in [roboard](https://romnml.rv7.ru) yourself, you won't be fined.

Users who's balance is over **500 chatles** got fined for **100 chatles** for a track.  
Users who's balance is over **100 chatles** got fined for **10 chatles** for a track.  
Users who's balance is under **100 chatles** got fined for **1 chatle** for a track.

We kindly requesting you to share music in 320 kbps MP3, or any lossless format (WAV/FLAC/AIFF), 44100 hz or above.

Let's try to keep it clean and strive to upload complete releases (ideally, with the links to the info). Or just bunches of tracks related to a certain artist.
